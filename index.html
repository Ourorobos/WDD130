                Wyoming was admited to the Union July 1890. It is the least populated state, 10th largest, and the 2nd lowest population density. The Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming, this is some times call the Edge of Creation by the locals. Leading to a windy and semi-arid land that is prone to large tempature swings.
